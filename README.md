# Prediction-of-Air-quality-index-data-using-machine-Learning
Abstractâ€”The prediction of air quality index (AQI) is crucial in managing the impact of air pollution on public health. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for predicting AQI levels by analyzing large datasets and identifying patterns to accurately predict AQI levels. 
The project will review related work on air quality prediction
using machine learning techniques, and evaluate the performance
of the models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error
(MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) to
determine which machine learning algorithms are best suited for
predicting AQI levels for different regions. By analyzing these
datasets and building prediction models, the project aims to
detect local trends and relate air quality changes to changes
in environmental policy. The project can help identify the main
sources of air pollution in a given region and develop targeted
policies to mitigate the effects of those sources.
The ultimate goal of this project is to improve human health
and well-being by providing individuals and organizations with
reliable information on air quality management. By developing
accurate predictive models using machine learning techniques
and a large dataset, this project aims to optimize air quality
management strategies and address real-world challenges in the
industry
